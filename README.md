# Preface
Hello! Welcome to my Kaggle repo. Here, I store all the notebooks that I have used in Kaggle Competitions.

Currently, I am a struggling Computer Science student in NUS and am an Kaggle Compeition Contributor. My next goal is to achieve a Bronze Medal in Competitions.

I was hoping that spamming Kaggle competitions would be fun and interesting to try out since I'm interested in ML/AI, and wish to become a Competitions Expert (although it seems impossible). I'm only
participating in beginner competitions as of now, but soon I might progress to harder ones.
